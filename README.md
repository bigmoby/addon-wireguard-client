WireGuard: fast, modern, secure VPN tunnel.

## About

[WireGuardÂ®][wireguard] is an extremely simple yet fast and modern VPN that
utilizes state-of-the-art cryptography. It aims to be faster, simpler, leaner,
and more useful than IPsec, while avoiding the massive headache.

It intends to be considerably more performant than OpenVPN. WireGuard is
designed as a general-purpose VPN for running on embedded interfaces and
supercomputers alike, fit for many different circumstances.

Initially released for the Linux kernel, it is now cross-platform (Windows,
macOS, BSD, iOS, Android) and widely deployable,
including via an Hass.io add-on!

WireGuard is currently under heavy development, but already it might be
regarded as the most secure, easiest to use, and the simplest VPN solution
in the industry.

## Breaking Changes

* __New repository url__

From version ___0.1.0___ will be dismissed the current repository and this will be the new repository url:

```text
https://github.com/bigmoby/hassio-repository-addon
```

* __Docker Hub pre-build add-on__

Update migration process from version ___0.0.3-SNAPSHOT___ to version ___0.0.4-SNAPSHOT___ fails because of new Docker Hub pre-build support.
__SO YOU MUST REMOVE AND INSTALL THE NEW ADD-ON VERSION__ ___MANUALLY.___

## Known issues

- **error setting key 'net.ipv4.conf.all.src_valid_mark'**

This add-on is not compatible with a catch-all value for allowed_ips, like 0.0.0.0/0. If you encounter this error

```
  [#] sysctl -q net.ipv4.conf.all.src_valid_mark=1
  sysctl: error setting key 'net.ipv4.conf.all.src_valid_mark': Read-only file system
```

it's because you are trying to create routes to/from every possible IP through the WireGuard interface. Simply use single ips or ip classes that need to be connected. If you don't own a static ip address you can consider a VPN.
